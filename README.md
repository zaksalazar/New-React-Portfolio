## User Story

AS a job seeker I want to showcase my deployed React portfolio of work samples
so that I can show I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Technologies Used
This portfolio uses React, Tailwind Css, and Email Js. 

## Getting Started
run 'npm i' in the command line, followed by 'node server' to open the application in your local server. 
Open the console when submitting an email in the form to ensure your 'message was sent'.
